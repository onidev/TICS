# TICS
Samples for The Integrated Circuit Simulator - A sandbox with logic gates

## Circuit

A circuit is based on wires and logic gates.
At the moment, an integrated circuit have inputs at the left and optional outputs at the right.

### Wires

Todo: Wire example

Todo: Bridge example

### Gates

There is 4 gates kind:
- #FF0000 And
- #800000 Nand
- #00FFFF Or
