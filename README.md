# TICS
Samples for The Integrated Circuit Simulator - A sandbox with logic gates

## Circuit

A circuit is based on wires and logic gates.
At the moment, an integrated circuit have inputs at the left and optional outputs at the right.

### Wires

A wire is defined by a pixel of color #FF8000. Diagonals and loops are not allowed.
Also you can't connect two inputs without a gate.

A bridge allows to cross two wires, and is defined by a pixel of color #804000.

### Gates

There is 4 gates kind:
- #FF0000 And
- #800000 Nand
- #00FFFF Or
- #0080FF Nor
